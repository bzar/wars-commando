Jump into the boots of a lone infantry soldier and blast your way through enemy lines to save your comrades from a looming defeat. Jump, run and fire your way through eight levels and five terrains, encounter a barrage of bullets, rockets, grenades, tank shells, automatic turrents and the eternal favorite of all platformer games: spikes! Take your enemies' weapons and turn them against them to defeat even the largest of tanks, the terror of the ground: the Heavy Tank. Be the hero your country needs! Be the Commando.
